        <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.</p>
        <p>Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game.</p>

    <p>While the modern game of golf originated in 15th-century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated. Some historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball.</p>
    <p>The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St. Andrews in 1764.</p>

          <p>The underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:
</p>
    <code></code>
    <p><i>Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair.</i></p>

          <p>There have been many people throughout history that attained notoriety and fame through their abilities to play golf well. Most of them went on to become professional golfers and earn a living playing golf as a career. Although golf was initially a game to be played by "gentlemen", many women have been very successful playing the game of golf and turning it into a career, same as men.</p>
    <p>I could list dozens more professional golfers, both man and woman alike, but that list can be found in a book or on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" target="_blank"><b>Wikipedia</b></a>
      (from where I grabbed snippets of information for this page). I'm keeping this list of great players short and sweet, but these are some of the greatest golfers in modern history.</p>

    <p>Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A "round" typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes.</p>
    <p>Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee).</p>
